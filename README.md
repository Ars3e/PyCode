## Welcome to PyCode!

**PyCode** is a collection of simple and useful Python scripts.  
This repository is designed for beginners in Python or for those looking for small, functional, and easy-to-understand programs.

---

## Features

- Simple and clean Python scripts
- Beginner-friendly
- Easy to modify and extend
- No external dependencies

---

## Why This Project?

I created this collection to practice basic programming concepts and to help beginners learn through simple, working examples.

## Included Scripts

### `character_counter.py`

A script that asks the user to enter a string and returns the number of characters entered, including spaces and punctuation.

**Usage Example:**
Enter a string: Hello, world! You entered 13 characters.

---

### `calculator.py`

A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
It also supports square roots and allows operations before calculating a square root.

**Usage Example:**
Choose operation: 1 (Addition) Enter first number: 5 Enter second number: 10 Result: 5 + 10 = 15
Choose operation: 5 (Square Root) Enter number: 25 Result: sqrt(25) = 5.0
